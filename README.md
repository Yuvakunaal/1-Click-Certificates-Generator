## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Trigger-Based Automation:** Instantly processes new entries added to a Google Sheet.
- **🔄 Fully Dynamic:** Supports any data field (e.g., `Name`, `Roll Number`, `Course`, `Date`).
- **☁️ Seamless Cloud Integration:** Connects Google Sheets with Google Drive via secure APIs.
- **⚙️ Zero Hard-Coding:** Entirely configurable through spreadsheet headers and PDF template placeholders.

## 📸 Proof of Concept & Results

The system ingests data from a structured Google Sheet:

The final, personalized certificates are generated and saved automatically to a designated Google Drive folder:

| :--: | :--: |
| **Generated Certificate 1** | **Generated Certificate 2** |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

This project demonstrates expertise in:

- **Workflow Orchestration:** Designing and deploying complex, reliable automations on a low-code platform.
- **API Integration:** RESTful integration with Google Workspace APIs and third-party PDF services.
- **System Design:** Architecting a scalable, event-driven pipeline for batch document processing.

- `/assets`: Screenshots and diagrams proving the functionality.
- `/samples`: Example input and output templates.

## 🔧 How It Works (High-Level Overview)

1.  **Data Source:** A Google Sheet is prepared with column headers matching the desired certificate fields.
2.  **Trigger:** The automation platform watches the sheet for new rows.
3.  **Processing:** For each new row, data is sent to a PDF generation service via API.
4.  **Generation:** A pre-designed template is populated with the dynamic data.
5.  **Delivery:** The finished PDF certificate is saved to a specified Google Drive folder.
